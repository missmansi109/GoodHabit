## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
TECH EXPLORER

### Team Members:  
- Aatifa 
- Kashish 
- Mansi
- Mehak


### Your Approach:  
We chose this idea because reading is a foundational habit that boosts knowledge and focus.

Our goal was to gamify reading using minimal yet effective tools.

We brainstormed several habit ideas before narrowing it down to reading.

During hacking, we figured out how to implement timers, local PDF reading, and save progress using PHP & MySQL.
